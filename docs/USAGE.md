# Usage

## CLI

```text
-config string         path to config file or a http(s) url (default "config.json")
-expand-env            expand environment variables in config file (default true)
-http-headers string   optional headers for config URL: 'Key1:Value1;Key2:Value2'
-http-timeout int      timeout (seconds) for remote config fetch (default 10)
-insecure              skip TLS verification for remote config
-authorize string      run a one-time interactive OAuth authorization for the
                        named mcpServers entry, then exit
-check-config          load and validate the config, then exit
-log-level value       log level: debug, info, warn, or error (default info)
-version               print version and exit
-help                  print help and exit
```

## Validating configuration

Use `-check-config` in CI, init containers, or deployment scripts to validate
the proxy settings and every downstream server without binding the HTTP port:

```bash
mcp-proxy -config config.json -check-config
# Config OK: 3 MCP server(s) configured
```

Validation includes transport requirements, absolute HTTP URLs, OAuth callback
safety, authentication tokens, and tool-filter modes. Invalid configuration
exits non-zero with the affected field or server name.

## Endpoints

Given `mcpProxy.baseURL = https://mcp.example.com` and a server key `fetch`:

- For `type: sse`: `https://mcp.example.com/fetch/sse`
- For `type: streamable-http`: `https://mcp.example.com/fetch/mcp`

## Health checks

Two unauthenticated endpoints are always served for liveness/readiness probes
(Docker, reverse proxies, dashboards, monitoring):

- `GET /_healthz` and `GET /_readyz` return `200` with a JSON status document.
- `HEAD /_healthz` and `HEAD /_readyz` return `200` with an empty body.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9090/_healthz
# {"name":"MCP Proxy","serverCount":3,"status":"ok","version":"1.0.0"}
```

These endpoints never require the proxy auth token.

## Auth

If `options.authTokens` is set for a server, requests must include a bearer token:

```
Authorization: <token>
```

If your client cannot set headers, embed the token in the route key (e.g. `fetch/<token>`) and call that path instead.

## OAuth-authorizing a downstream server

For servers configured with an `oauth` block (see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#oauth)),
run the authorization flow once, by hand, before starting (or restarting)
the daemon:

```bash
mcp-proxy -authorize notion -config path/to/config.json
```

This opens your default browser to the provider's consent screen, waits
for the local redirect callback, exchanges the code for a token, and saves
it to disk. Run it interactively, in a session with a real browser -
never from an unattended service/container, since it requires you to log
in and approve access.

No restart needed. A server's route is always mounted; if it had no valid
credential at startup it responds `503 Service Unavailable` (with the
exact `-authorize` command to run) instead of proxying, and the *next*
request against that route - after running `-authorize` - retries the
connection and starts proxying on success, with no restart and no re-mount
(see [OAUTH_LIFECYCLE.md](OAUTH_LIFECYCLE.md)). After a route is working,
tokens refresh automatically as they expire, same as always. Re-run
`-authorize` only if the server reports the token is no longer valid (e.g.
access was revoked).
